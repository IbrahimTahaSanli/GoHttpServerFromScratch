# GoHttpServerFromScratch(Still Working On It)

Simple Http Server Codded With Go.
For Now It's Working Only Get.(I Can't Say It's Working Properly)

Capabilities:
  - Basic Get Response Handleing.
  - Logging Into Sql DB. I Am Using SQLite 3(<a href="github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3">Github Page</a>)But If You Want To Convert Other Databases, I Guess Isn't Hard To Done.
  - Get All Responses From DB To Easy Managment.

To-Do:
  - Need To Work On Safety.
  - Error Handling.
  - Comments.
  - Some Crashes

Test-Cases:
  I Added test-cases.txt File. It Stores Test Cases In Patern Request\tWhat Has Been Ocured => What Is Doing Now. If You Find Any Crashs, Security Holes Or Something Wrong I Would Be Happy To Fix It.
